# Task 3: Position + nth-child

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **CSS position** and **nth-child selectors** to replicate given design layouts. The task strictly avoids the use of **Flexbox, Grid, Class, and ID selectors**, ensuring a focus on basic CSS styling techniques. All code is written in **one HTML file** and **one CSS file**.
